# Simple Boggle Game

All this does is create a new board and then it lets you type in names to see if the word is in the board. 

It does not validate whether the word is a valid word (although, it could). I just haven't added it yet.

When you are done, you hit <Enter> an extra time and it will use a dictionary of words to show you all the words it could find.
